Description: A tool for producing synthetic versions of microdata
    containing confidential information so that they are safe to be
    released to users for exploratory analysis. The key objective of
    generating synthetic data is to replace sensitive original values with
    synthetic ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical
    information contained in the data set. Variables, which can be
    categorical or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using sequential
    modelling. Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional
    distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or
    classification and regression trees models. Data are synthesised via
    the function syn() which can be largely automated, if default settings
    are used, or with methods defined by the user. Optional parameters can
    be used to influence the disclosure risk and the analytical quality of
    the synthesised data. For a description of the implemented method see
    Nowok, Raab and Dibben (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v074.i11>.
